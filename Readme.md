# PRACTICALS PROGRAMMING IN PYTHON

## Welcome  ! ðŸ‘‹

## ========================================================================================================================================

### File Name of practicals exercises : DSA.pdf

### Author: Mouliom Pagna Mohamed A

### Profile: Master Degree in PHYSICS Option Materials Sciences, Undergraduation in DATA SCIENCE At AIMS(African Institute for Mathematicals Sciences) Cameroon

## =========================================================================================================================================

### Description    : In this series of practicals, we will solved differents problems on several topics base on the file name DSA.pdf (Take a look of the file)

### Hints

1. Our method is to write python code for the different problem

2. For every problem we will subdivide the resolution of the problem such that every function written will be trating a specific aspect helping to solve the problem
in general

3. For every problem, a hint for resolution will be given inside the readme of the problem folder in order to help you in your comprehension

4. A resolution code will be given also base on the hint given

5. Make sure to try your best before looking for the correction code that will be share for the problem.

6. I want to add also that every programmer has his own signature when coding and his way to take on the problem he is facing, so you are not oblige to code like me but i advise you to follow that traditionnal codeing way because it will help you in the future.

7. Don't hesiate to contact me if you have a suitable way better than mine to solve the problem since we are all learning and for anyu other question or issues you are facing when reading my codes.

#### Good luck ðŸš€
